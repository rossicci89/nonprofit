#### Sierra Club

Started in 1892, The Sierra Club’s founding mission was to protect wild, ecological communities and the earth as a whole, after its founding members, namely John Muir, saw the looming environmental destruction the industrial revolution had catalyzed. They are unquestionably the largest, oldest and most powerful environmental group in America. They have about 10,000 members. They have four program areas, Health & Environment, Protecting Biodiversity, Atmosphere & Energy and Transitions to a Sustainable Economy.
